# TODOs
- [x] Create a sheet called `Danh sách gửi mail`
- [x] Clone data from original sheet to another
- [x] Get sheet by name, not by using `getActiveSheet`# truc-lam-meditation-course-for-adult
- [x] Filter duplicated names and date of birth for kids
- [x] Dynamic content such as current year, target students..., etc coming from "Lưu trữ" 
- [x] Apply dynamic content to the form so that the user only needs to fill data to the sheet "Lưu trữ"
- [ ] Update `testSendBusFeePaymentReminder` function to remind payment about 2 days after registration but still before payment deadline
